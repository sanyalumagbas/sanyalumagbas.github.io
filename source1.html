                <br>Equipped with a 100% vaccination shield, are students’ lives worth enough for their pursuit of education?
                <br>
                <br>
                In a sea of various learning methods, we are all adrift with sails damaged by the limits
                given by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sailors like us are eyeing the port to better education: how can
                we strive for more knowledge if we do not know what method suits us best? Of course, the
                government’s plan to supply us with tablets, SIM cards and second-hand laptops made it easier
                for us students to access knowledge stopped by distance. With the usual face-to-face classes
                prohibited, social interaction is limited and lingering questions remained unaddressed.
                However, these possibilities were ignored by Bulacan who stubbornly resumed classes
                even when the Philippines’ current state does not prove the pandemic’s end.<br>
                <br>
                As soon as we welcomed January 2022 with fireworks, COVID-19 cases also reached the
                skies. When both students and teachers, even in the midst of their homes, were plagued by the
                disease, the Department of Education announced a sudden, academic break. Around this
                moment, fully-vaccinated Bulakenyos were already nearing 97% of the eligible population.
                According to an article by Inquirer, the province was not exempted from this spike in cases, which
                reached 393 active cases as of January 2. Are we underestimating COVID-19 for the sake of us
                being vaccinated? Being inoculated with the vaccine does not mean that everyone is literally
                invincible against the said virus. Yes, the severity of the disease is lessened. Most vaccination
                efficacies are above 90% but are we willing to sacrifice others, especially students, whose lives
                are hanging on this percentage? When education remains accessible in the safety of their homes,
                why would they need to go further and get out of their safe zone? <br>
                <br>
                All of us long for the day we could all rip the masks off our faces and laugh with our
                classmates and teachers like how we were before the pandemic happened. This hope is not
                meant to be tainted with a hasty implementation of a face-to-face class just because everyone is
                already protected. Easing restrictions comes with higher risks in contracting the disease.
                Everyone must wait; there will come a time when this pandemic will turn endemic.<br>
                <br>
                As we try to adapt and survive against the unpredictable, we should never forget that the
                virus is also trying to live with us as its enemies. With the rise of several distance learning
                methods, the changes we are used to will soon be the usual. When our invisible adversary hits
                us where it hurts the most, who knows what will happen if we remain blinded on the failure face-
                to-face classes might bring.<br>
